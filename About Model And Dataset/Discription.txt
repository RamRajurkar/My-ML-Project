Your project is well-structured and follows a standard machine learning workflow. Here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Data Exploration and Visualization:**
   - Good use of Pandas and Matplotlib for data exploration and visualization. Consider adding more detailed explanations or insights gained from the visualizations in comments or markdown cells to enhance readability.

2. **Train-Test Splitting:**
   - The train-test split is done correctly. However, consider using the stratified split for the entire dataset instead of just for the CHAS variable to ensure the training and test sets have similar distributions across all variables.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Creating the `TAXRM` feature is a good attempt at feature engineering. Consider exploring other potential features that could improve model performance.

4. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Using the `SimpleImputer` to fill missing values is appropriate. However, you could explore other imputation strategies or techniques to handle missing data, such as using more sophisticated imputation models like KNNImputer.

5. **Data Processing Pipeline:**
   - The use of a pipeline for data preprocessing is a good practice. Consider adding more preprocessing steps or trying different scaling methods to see if they improve model performance.

6. **Model Selection and Evaluation:**
   - Trying out different regression models and evaluating them using RMSE is a standard approach. Consider also using other evaluation metrics and comparing the models' performance to choose the best one.

7. **Cross-Validation:**
   - Using cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance is great. Consider visualizing the cross-validation results to get a better understanding of the model's variability.

8. **Saving and Using the Model:**
   - Saving the trained model for later use is a good practice. Consider also evaluating the model on completely unseen data to ensure its generalization performance.

Overall, your project demonstrates a good understanding of machine learning concepts and practices. Consider exploring more advanced techniques and experimenting with different approaches to improve your model's performance further.
